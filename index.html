     <!-- the letter to my brother -->
    
        Hope you're doing well! I wanted to share some exciting news about my new college,SQI College of ICT. I'm loving it here! The college has great facilities, experienced teachers, and a supportive environment. I'm learning a lot and enjoying the practical 
        approach to ICT education. 
        
        The best part is the industry-relevant curriculum, which prepares us for real-world 
        challenges. I've already made some great friends, and we're having a blast together. 
        
        I think I made the right choice joining SQI College of ICT. I'm looking forward to 
        achieving my goals and starting a successful career in ICT. 
        
        Take care, bro! Let's catch up soon. <
